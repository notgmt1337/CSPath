Tutorial: Using CSPath
======================

Introduction To Shortest-Path Problems
--------------------------------------
Shortest-path problems are ubiquitous. An alarming number of the world's software would not be possible without shortest-path algorithms. To try and motivate why such software is needed: Imagine you are on vacation in Paris, France and would like to visit the Eiffel tower, starting from your hotel. You have purchased a map of Paris and you are trying to plan your way there. You quickly notice that there isn't just one route going from your hotel to the Eiffel tower, but rather a lot of them. Your next question is: What is the shortest route -in terms of distance- going from your hotel to the Eiffel tower?

This is basically what is called a "shortest-path problem". The keyword "shortest" need not refer to distance, but rather to the universal idea of cost. This interpretation is what abstractifies shortest-path algorithms and makes things such as friend-suggestions in Facebook possible.

To formally introduce what a shortest-path problem is, we need to define some measures that rely heavily on graph theory terminology. If your graph theory is a bit rusty, please visit the `Bibliography`_ section.

Installing CSPath
----------------------
Version 1.0.0 is not available for installation via pip, anaconda or others. Thus, the only way to install CSPath 1.0.0 is to download the source from GitHub (https://github.com/notgmt1337/CSPath) to your system.
