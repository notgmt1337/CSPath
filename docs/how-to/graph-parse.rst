Graph-parsing is essential to CSPath. Version 1.0.0 offers two methods of parsing graphs.

Method 1: Using a Distance Matrix
---------------------------------

Let :math:`n` denote the number of nodes in the graph. Let :math:`d(n_{1}, n_{2})` be the distance function, taking two nodes as input.  


Method 2: Using Cartesian Coordinates
-------------------------------------
